# Java-Python-Diabetes-Predictor
A Java Swing-based diabetes prediction app powered by a Python machine learning model, with printable health reports and user-friendly interface.
This project is a cross-language desktop application for predicting the risk of diabetes using a trained machine learning model in Python and an interactive Java Swing GUI. Users can input medical parameters such as glucose levels, BMI, insulin, and age to get an instant prediction along with lifestyle suggestions. The app also generates a printable test report with all entered values and prediction results.

Features:

User-friendly Java Swing interface with input hints and value ranges.

Integration with Python's trained ML model for accurate predictions.

Instant test result display with probability score.

Printable and savable diabetes test report.

"Test Again" button for quick retests.

Tech Stack:

Frontend/UI: Java Swing

Backend/Prediction: Python (scikit-learn, pandas, joblib)

Report Generation: Java Printing API
